<h1>NTM Application (Whatsapp Clone)</h1>

The first part of a rolling project of building Whats App Clone. 


<h2>description:</h2>

When you launch the app, the Login page opens, from that page you can go to the sign-up screen(register page) if you are not registered to the app. 
After successful registration, you'll be taken to the Login page to connect with your new user. 
 
Upon login, the app will open, empty of content, now by clicking the Add Chat button, which can be found Next to your profile picture, you can attach chats with people who sign up for the app.

There is a registered hard-coded user with the details:
<h4>Username: bob, password: bob1, display name: bob bobby.</h4>

This user has five open chats with different types of text messages between them that were also inserted in Hard-Coded. 
You can sign in to the other users, who have no chats at all, but of course you can add a new chat with one of the registered users and send messages. 

The users are:
(Users that created as Hard-Coded)
1. Username - noamit, password - noa1, display name - noa amit. 
2. Username - tomerk, password - tomer1, display name - Tomer Hadar. 
3. Username - mommy, password - mommy1, display name - best mommy. 
4. Username - daddy, password - daddy1, display name - best daddy. 
5. Username - sister, password - sister1, display name - my sister.  
 
Of course, you can also sign up with as many different users as you want and open chats with them and not just with the users that inserted as Hard-Coded. 
 
By the username of an already registered user you can open a new chat with him. 
 

When you enter any chat, you can also send new messages from different types, When you send a recording/picture/video, there's a preview look at the content you want to send, In this way, you can see before sending what the content looks like or what the recording sounds like before sending, and of course there is the possibility of canceling the submission when the message is displayed before it is sent.
